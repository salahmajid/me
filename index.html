            <h2>Introduction:</h2>
            <p>Hey, my name is Salah and I am a computer science major. I am the youngest in my family.
                I have 5 brothers and 4 sisters. I also have 15 nephews/nieces (1 nephew is older than me by 1 year and
                1 niece
                is the same age as me). My family and I are from Palestine, but I was born here in Illinois.</p>

            <h2>What I Hope to Learn in this Course:</h2>
            <p>I hope to learn more about the software engineering process and learn how to properly apply all of the
                knowledge I have
                accumulated over the past years to this course. I hope to have a great semester and improve as much as
                possible on my technical, social, and professional skills.</p>
